# c chess engine
This was me attempting to make a chess engine in C before i had enough experience and skill with the language. I got as far as partly completeing move generation, but i had overall issue with debugging, the printing format specifiers making it especially hard to do so, and just a general lack of experience in C. Still decent though with bitboards
